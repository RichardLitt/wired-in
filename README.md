About Wired In
----
This is my joint time tracker and task organiser. Sometime around
October 2011 I got fedup using post it notes, text files, complicated
local wordpress installations, etc. to keep track of what I do, how I do
it, and when I do it. I figured with a lot of work I could make a
program that does it better - this is the result, still in progress. 

It is free to use and develop; fork away. I use it daily. I have loaded two example files that show how the information is stored. I would like to move away from .csv eventually.

Some files - my current tasks, lists, and subfunctions - are not included for privacy reasons (obviously, I don't want everyone knwoing what I actually do all day.). These files are privately stored in a bitbucket and should not appear in here.

I originally hadn't intended to make this public - there are a lot of
small bugs that may need to be fixed. There's also a lot of references
to the film Avatar - this started out being called Mask On, the idea
being that I wanted to put my mask on when I went out into the jungle.
Obviously this, and all other references, are merely for my own personal
amusement, and shouldn't be taken too seriously. Skxawng.

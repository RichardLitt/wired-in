This is my joint time tracker and task organiser. Sometime around
October 2011 I got fedup using post it notes, text files, complicated
local wordpress installations, etc. to keep track of what I do, how I do
it, and when I do it. I figured with a lot of work I could make a
program that does it better - this is the result, still in progress. 

It is free to use and develop, but I would appreciate if you let me know if you do so! I have loaded two example files that show how the information is stored. I would like to move away from csv, especially as I am currently hacking around ', ' and ',', but that's a story for another time. If you have updates for me, or suggesitons, do let me know!

Some files - my current tasks, lists, and subfunctions - are not included for privacy reasons (obviously, I don't want everyone knwoing what I actually do all day.). These files are privately stored in a bitbucket and should not appear in here.

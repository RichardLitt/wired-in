This is my time tracker and task organiser.
Work began on it in October, 2011.

It is free to use and develop, but I would appreciate if you let me know if you do so!

I have loaded two example files that can be used to start from.

Plans: integrate with SQL, or maybe with Wordpress.

Some files - my current tasks, lists, and subfunctions - are not included.

These files are privately stored in  bitbucket and should not appear in here.
